# mime-db-lite
A tiny, lightweight JavaScript API to query [mime-db](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db) (Media-type / MIME-type database).

Sources data from [mime-db-cdn](https://github.com/SomajitDey/mime-db-cdn), which is equivalent to [mime-db](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db) but enables selective downloads over CDN, for any given database query.
